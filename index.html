               <h4>Biography</h4>
               <p>For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their
                  grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language
                  would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be
                  necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce,
                  the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual
                  languages. </p>
